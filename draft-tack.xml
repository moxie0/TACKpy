This document defines TACK, a TLS Extension that enables a TLS server to
assert the authenticity of its public key. A TACK contains a "TACK key" 
which is used to sign the public key from the TLS server's certificate. 
Hostnames can be "pinned" to a TACK key. TLS connections to a pinned 
hostname require the server to present a TACK containing the pinned key
and a corresponding signature over the TLS server's public key.

			</t>

			<t>

Traditionally, a TLS client verifies a TLS server's public key using a
certificate chain issued by some public CA. "Pinning" is a way for clients to
obtain increased certainty in server public keys. Clients that employ pinning
check for some constant "pinned" element of the TLS connection when
contacting a particular TLS host.

 </t> <t>

Unfortunately, a number of problems arise when attempting to pin certificate
chains: the TLS servers at a given hostname may have different certificate
chains simultaneously deployed and may change their chains at any time, the
"more constant" elements of a chain (the CAs) may not be trustworthy, and the
client may be oblivious to key compromise events which render the pinned data
untrustworthy.

			</t> 

	<t>

TACK addresses these problems by having the site sign its TLS server public
keys with a "TACK key". This enables clients to "pin" a hostname to the TACK
key without requiring sites to modify their existing certificate chains, and
without limiting a site's flexibility to deploy different certificate chains
on different servers or change certificate chains at any time. Since TACK pins
are based on TACK keys (instead of CA keys), trust in CAs is not required.
Additionally, the TACK key may be used to revoke previous TACK signatures (or
even itself) in order to handle the compromise of TLS or TACK private keys.

	</t>
	<t>

If requested, a compliant server will send a TLS Extension containing its
"TACK". Inside the TACK is a public key and signature. Once a client has seen
the same (hostname, TACK public key) pair multiple times, the client will
"activate" a pin between the hostname and TACK key for a period equal to the
length of time the pair has been observed for. This "pin activation" process
limits the impact of bad pins resulting from transient network attacks or
operator error.

			</t>
			<t>

TACK pins are easily shared between clients. For example, a TACK client
may scan the internet to discover TACK pins, then publish these pins for other
clients to rely upon.

<section title="Overview">

<section title="TACK life cycle">

<t>A server operator using TACK may perform several processes:

	<list style="hanging">
	<t hangText="Selection of a TACK key:">	

The server operator first chooses the ECDSA signing key to use for a set of
hostnames. It is safest to use a different signing key for each hostname,
though a signing key may be reused for closely-related hostnames (such as
aliases for the same host, or hosts sharing the same TLS key).

	</t>
	<t hangText="Creating initial TACKs under a TACK key:">	

The TACK private key is then used to sign the TLS public keys for all servers
associated with those hostnames. The TACK public key and signature are
combined with some metadata into each server's "TACK".

	</t>
	<t hangText="Deploying initial TACKs:">	

For each hostname, TACKs are deployed to TLS servers in a two-stage process.
First, each TLS server associated with the hostname is given a TACK. Once this
is completed, pin activation is enabled on the servers.

	</t>
	
	<t hangText="Creating new TACKs under a TACK key:">	

A TACK needs to be replaced whenever a server changes its TLS public key, or
when the TACK expires. TACKs may also need to be replaced with
later-generation TACKs if the TACK key's "min_generation" is updated (see
next).

	</t>
	<t hangText="Revoking old TACKs:">

If a TLS private key is compromised, the TACKs signing this key can be revoked by
publishing a new TACK containing a higher "min_generation".

	</t>
	<t hangText="Revoking TACK keys:">

If a TACK private key is compromised, or a server operator wishes to stop using
TACK or abruptly change its TACK key for any reason, a server can revoke an entire
TACK key (including all TACKs and pins referring to it) by publishing a "break
signature".

</section>

<section title="Pin life cycle">
	
	<t>

A TACK client maintains a store of pins for verifying TLS connections. Pins
associate a hostname and a TACK key. When a client sees a new hostname and
TACK key combination, an inactive pin is created. Every subsequent time the
client sees the same pin, the pin is "activated" for a period equal to the
timespan between the first time the pin was seen and the most recent time, up
to a maximum period of 30 days.

</t> 
<t>

Pin activation prevents an attacker with short-lived control of the hostname
from activating long-lived pins. It also makes it safer for sites to
experiment with TACKs, as a new TACK can be discarded without causing
long-lived problems. The 30 day limit guarantees that a worst-case pin can be
recovered from in reasonable time.

</t>


 <t>In addition to creating and activating pins, a TLS connection can alter the
   clients's pin store by publishing revocation data:<list
style="hanging"> <t hangText="Min_generation:">

Each pin stores the highest "min_generation" value it has seen from the pinned
TACK key, and rejects TACKs from earlier generations.

A TLS handshake may send break signatures which cause all pins for the
broken key to be discarded.

<t>

A client supporting TACK SHALL have a local store of pins, consisting of "key
records" and "name records". Each name record is associated with a key record.
Multiple name records MAY be associated with one key record. A "pin" refers to
a (name record, key record) pair.

</t> 
<t>

 A "key record" contains:

<list style="empty">
<t>

TACK public key (or hash): A public key or a cryptographically-secure, second
preimage-resistant hash of a public key. A client SHALL NOT store multiple key
records referencing the same key.

</t>

Min_generation: A single byte used to detect revoked TACKs.

</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>

A "name record" contains:

<list style="empty">

<t>

Name: A fully qualified DNS hostname. A client SHALL NOT store multiple name
records with the same name. The TLS server's hostname is considered the
"relevant name", and a pin whose name exactly matches the relevant name is
considered a "relevant pin".

</t>
<t>

Initial timestamp: A timestamp noting when this pin was created.

</t> 
 <t>

Active period end: Empty or a timestamp. If empty or set to a time in the
past, the pin is "inactive". If set to a future time, the pin is "active"
until that time.

</section>

<section title="High-level client processing">

<t>

A TACK client SHALL send the "tack" extension defined previously, as well as
the "server_name" extension from <xref target="RFC6066"/> indicating the
hostname the client is contacting. If not resuming a session, the server MAY
respond with a TACK_Extension. A TACK client SHALL perform the following steps
prior to using a non-resumed connection:

<list style="numbers">
 <t>Check whether the TLS handshake is "well-formed".</t>
 <t>Check the TACK generation and update min_generation.</t>
 <t>Check whether the TACK is expired.</t>
 <t>Create and activate pins (optional).</t> 
 <t>Discard pins based on break signatures.</t>
</list>

These steps SHALL be performed in order. If there is any error, the client
SHALL send a fatal error alert and close the connection, skipping the
remaining steps (see <xref target="details"/> for details).

</t>

<t>

After the above steps, if there is a relevant active pin and a TACK whose key
is referenced by the pin, then the connection is verified by the pin. If there
is a relevant active pin but no such TACK, the connection is rejected by the
pin. </t>

<t> A rejected connection might indicate a network attack. If the connection
is rejected the client SHOULD send a fatal "access_denied" error alert and
close the connection. </t>

<t>A client MAY choose to perform additional verification steps before using a
connection verified by a pin, or a connection with no relevant active pin. See
<xref target="certver"/> for an example.</t>

the connection.
</t>

<t> Otherwise, if there is a TACK and a key record referencing the TACK key,
and the TACK's min_generation is greater than the key record's min_generation,

<section title="Create and activate pins (optional)" anchor="creating">

<t>

The TLS connection MAY be used to create, delete, and activate pins as
described in this section. Note that this section is optional; a client MAY
rely on an external source of pins, provided the external pins are produced by
a client following the below algorithms.

</t>
<t>

If there is a TACK and a relevant pin referencing the TACK key, and pin
activation is enabled, the name record's "active period end" SHALL be set
using the below formula (where "current" is the current time, and "initial" is
the "initial timestamp" from the name record):

</t> <figure><artwork>
active_period_end = current + MIN(30 days, current - initial)
</artwork></figure>	
<t>

If there is a TACK and either no relevant pin or an inactive relevant pin that
does not reference the TACK key, a new pin SHALL be created:

<list style="numbers">
<t>If the TACK key is referenced by an existing
key record, the key record is reused, otherwise a new key record is created
with the TACK's key and min_generation.</t>
<t>A new name record is created

time, and an empty "active period end".</t>	

<t>If there is an existing relevant pin, the pin SHALL be deleted (see <xref

</list>
</t>

<t> If there is no TACK and the relevant pin is inactive, the pin SHALL be

<section title="Deleting pins" anchor="deleting">

<t>

A client might need to delete a pin from its store as a result of the
algorithms in <xref target="creating"/>. A client MAY also delete pins from
its store at any time, whether to save space, protect privacy, or for any
other reason. To delete a pin, its name record SHALL be removed. If this
leaves a key record with no associated name records, the key record MAY be
removed as well. Pins MAY be deleted regardless of whether they are active or
inactive, however for security concerns regarding pin deletion, see <xref
target="security_client"/>.

</t>
<t>
</t>
<t>

Deleting pins unnecessarily will reduce the benefits of TACK, so SHOULD be
avoided. Note that a pin SHOULD NOT be deleted simply because it has become
inactive. Instead, such a pin SHOULD be retained, so that it can be
re-activated in the future by the algorithms in <xref target="creating"/>.

</t>
</section>
</section>	
<section title="Certificate verification and TACK" anchor="certver">

 <t>

A TACK client MAY choose to perform some form of certificate verification in
addition to TACK processing. When combining certificate verification and TACK
processing, the TACK processing described in <xref target="clientproc"/> SHALL
be followed exactly. TACK processing SHALL NOT be altered or terminated early
as a result of errors discovered during certificate verification.

</t>
<t>

If TACK processing and certificate verification both complete without a fatal
error, the client SHALL apply some policy to decide whether to accept the
connection. The policy is up to the client. An example policy would be to
accept the connection only if it passes certificate verification and is not
rejected by a pin.

</t>

</section>

<section title="Application-specific pinning">

<t>

In addition to the hostname-based pinning described above, some applications
may require "application-specific pins", where an application-layer name is
pinned to a TACK key. For example, an SMTP MTA may wish to authenticate
receiving MTAs by pinning email domains to the receiving MTAs' TACK keys.

</t>
<t>

Application-specific pins may require redefinition of the name record's "name"
field, the "relevant name" for the TLS connection, and the "pin activation"
signal. With these items redefined, the client processing rules in <xref
target="clientproc"/> may be reused.

</t>

<t>Note that a server using application-specific pins is still subject to
hostname pins, and a client MAY apply either or both forms of pinning when
checking whether the TLS connection is verified. </t>

The specification of application-specific pinning for particular applications
is outside the scope of this document.

<section title="TACK IDs">	
<t>

A "TACK ID" MAY be used to represent a TACK public key to users in a form that
is relatively easy to compare and transcribe. A TACK ID consists of the first
25 characters from the base32 encoding of SHA256(public_key), separated into 5
groups of 5 characters separated by periods. Base32 encoding is as specified

<t>
<list style="hanging">

<t hangText="Key reuse:">

All servers that are pinned to a single TACK key are able to impersonate each
other, since clients will perceive their TACKs as equivalent. Thus, TACK keys
SHOULD NOT be reused with different hostnames unless these hostnames are
closely related. Examples where it would be safe to reuse a TACK key are
hostnames aliased to the same host, hosts sharing the same TLS key, or
hostnames for a pool of near-identical servers.

</t>

<t hangText="Aliases:">

A TLS server may be referenced by multiple hostnames. Clients may pin any of
these hostnames. Server operators should be careful when using such DNS
aliases that hostnames are not pinned inadvertently.

</t>

<t hangText="Generations:">

To revoke older generations of TACKs, the server operator SHOULD first provide
all servers with a new generation of TACKs, and only then provide servers with
new TACKs containing the new min_generation. Otherwise, a client may receive a
min_generation update from one server but then try to contact an
older-generation server which has not yet been updated.</t>

<t hangText="Signature expiration:">

It is convenient to set the TACK expiration equal to the end-entity
certificate expiration, so that the TACK and certificate may both be replaced
at the same time. Alternatively, short-lived TACKs may be used so that a
compromised TLS private key has limited value to an attacker.</t>

<t hangText="Break signatures:">

A break signature only needs to be published for a time interval equal to the
maximum active period of any affected pins. For example, if a TACK has been only
been published on a website for 24 hours, to remove the TACK only requires
publishing the break signature for 24 hours.

</t>
<t hangText="Pin activation:">

Pin activation SHOULD only be enabled once all TLS servers sharing the same
hostname have a TACK. Otherwise, a client may activate a pin by contacting one
server, then contact a different server at the same hostname that does not yet
have a TACK. </t>

<t hangText="Pin deactivation:">The pin_activation field can be used to phase
out TACKs for a hostname. If all servers at a hostname disable pin activation,
all existing pins for the hostname will eventually become inactive, at which
point the servers' TACKs can be removed.

<t hangText="Sharing pin information:">

It is possible for a client to maintain a pin store based entirely on its own
TLS connections. However, such a client runs the risk of creating incorrect
pins, failing to keep its pins active, or failing to receive revocation
information (min_generation updates and break signatures). Clients are advised
to collaborate so that pin data can be aggregated and shared. This will
require additional protocols outside the scope of this document.

</t> <t hangText="Clock synchronization:">

A client SHOULD take measures to prevent TACKs from being erroneously rejected
due to an inaccurate client clock. Such methods MAY include using time
synchronization protocols such as NTP <xref target="RFC5905"/>, or accepting
seemingly-expired TACKs if they expired less than T minutes ago, where T is a
"tolerance bound" set to the client's maximum expected clock error.

locations where they can't be compromised.

</t>
<t>

A TACK private key MUST NOT be used to perform any non-TACK cryptographic
operations. For example, using a TACK key for email encryption, code-signing,
or any other purpose MUST NOT be done.

</t> <t>

HTTP cookies <xref target="RFC6265"/> set by a pinned host can be stolen by a
network attacker who can forge web and DNS responses so as to cause a client
to send the cookies to a phony subdomain of the pinned host. To prevent this,
TACK HTTPS Servers SHOULD set the "secure" attribute and omit the "domain"
attribute on all security-sensitive cookies, such as session cookies. These
settings tell the browser that the cookie should only be presented back to the
originating host (not its subdomains), and should only be sent over HTTPS (not
HTTP) <xref target="RFC6265"/>.

<t>

A TACK pin store may contain private details of the client's connection
history. An attacker may be able to access this information by hacking or
stealing the client. Some information about the client's connection history
could also be gleaned by observing whether the client accepts or rejects
connections to phony TLS servers without correct TACKs. To mitigate these
risks, a TACK client SHOULD allow the user to edit or clear the pin store.

</t>

<t>

Aside from rejecting TLS connections, clients SHOULD NOT take any actions
which would reveal to a network observer the state of the client's pin store,
as this would allow an attacker to know in advance whether a
"man-in-the-middle" attack on a particular TLS connection will succeed or be
detected.

</t>

<t>

An attacker may attempt to flood a client with spurious TACKs for different
hostnames, causing the client to delete old pins to make space for new ones.
To defend against this, clients SHOULD NOT delete active pins to make space
for new pins. Clients instead SHOULD delete inactive pins. If there are no
inactive pins to delete, then the pin store is full and there is no space for
new pins. To select an inactive pin for deletion, the client SHOULD delete the
pin with the oldest "active_period_end".

<t>

If the need arises for TACKs using different cryptographic algorithms (e.g.,
if SHA256 or ECDSA are shown to be weak), a "v2" version of TACKs could be
defined, requiring assignment of a new TLS Extension number. TACKs as defined
in this document would then be known as "v1" TACKs.
