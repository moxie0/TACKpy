Abstract

   This document defines TACK, a TLS Extension that enables a TLS server
   to assert the authenticity of its public key.  A TACK contains a
   "TACK key" which is used to sign the public key from the TLS server's
   certificate.  Hostnames can be "pinned" to a TACK key.  TLS
   connections to a pinned hostname require the server to present a TACK
   containing the pinned key and a corresponding signature over the TLS
   server's public key.

Internet-Draft    Trust Assertions for Certificate Keys         May 2012


1.  Introduction

   Traditionally, a TLS client verifies a TLS server's public key using
   a certificate chain issued by some public CA.  "Pinning" is a way for
   clients to obtain increased certainty in server public keys.  Clients
   that employ pinning check for some constant "pinned" element of the
   TLS connection when contacting a particular TLS host.

   Unfortunately, a number of problems arise when attempting to pin
   certificate chains: the TLS servers at a given hostname may have
   different certificate chains simultaneously deployed and may change
   their chains at any time, the "more constant" elements of a chain
   (the CA certs) may not be trustworthy, and the client may be
   oblivious to key compromise events which render the pinned data
   untrustworthy.

   TACK addresses these problems by having the site sign its TLS server
   public keys with a "TACK key".  This enables clients to "pin" a
   hostname to the TACK key without requiring sites to modify their
   existing certificate chains, and without limiting a site's
   flexibility to deploy different certificate chains on different
   servers or change certificate chains at any time.  Since TACK pins
   are based on TACK keys (instead of CA keys), trust in CAs is not
   required.  Additionally, the TACK key may be used to revoke previous
   TACK signatures (or even itself) in order to handle the compromise of
   TLS or TACK private keys.

   If requested, a compliant server will send a TLS Extension containing
   its "TACK".  Inside the TACK is a public key and signature.  Once a
   client has seen the same (hostname, TACK public key) pair multiple
   times, the client will "activate" a pin between the hostname and TACK
   key for a period equal to the length of time the pair has been
   observed for.  This "pin activation" process limits the impact of bad
   pins resulting from transient network attacks or operator error.

   TACK pins are easily shared between clients.  For example, a TACK
   client may scan the internet to discover TACK pins, then publish
   these pins for other clients to rely upon.

   TACK and certificate chain verification are independent processes.  A
   TACK client MAY additionally verify the server's certificate chain,
   or perform other processes to verify the server's public key, but
   these are outside the scope of the current document.

3.  Overview

3.1.  TACK life cycle

   A server operator using TACK may perform several processes:

   Selection of a TACK key:  The server operator first chooses the ECDSA
      signing key to use for a set of hostnames.  It is safest to use a
      different signing key for each hostname, though a signing key may
      be shared between closely-related hostnames (such as aliases for
      the same host).

   Creating initial TACKs under a TACK key:  The TACK private key is
      then used to sign the TLS public keys for all servers associated
      with those hostnames.  The TACK public key and signature are
      combined with some metadata into each server's "TACK".

   Deploying initial TACKs:  For each hostname, TACKs are deployed to
      TLS servers in a two-stage process.  First, each TLS server
      associated with the hostname is given a TACK.  Once this is
      completed, pin activation is enabled on the servers.

   Creating new TACKs under a TACK key:  A TACK must be replaced
      whenever a server changes its TLS public key, or when the TACK
      expires.  TACKs may also need to be replaced with later-generation
      TACKs if the TACK key's "min_generation" is updated (see next).

   Revoking old TACKs:  If a TLS private key is compromised, the TACKs
      signing this key can be revoked by publishing a new TACK
      containing a higher "min_generation".

   Revoking TACK keys:  If a TACK private key is compromised, or a
      server operator wishes to stop using TACK or abruptly change its
      TACK key for any reason, a server can revoke an entire TACK key
      (including all TACKs and pins referring to it) by publishing a
      "break signature".

3.2.  Pin life cycle

   A TACK client maintains a store of pins for verifying TLS
   connections.  Pins associate a hostname and a TACK key.  When a
   client sees a new hostname and TACK key combination, an inactive pin
   is created.  Once the client has seen the pin more than once, the pin
   is "activated" for a period equal to the timespan between the first
   time the pin was seen and the most recent time, up to a maximum
   period of 30 days.

   Pin activation prevents an attacker with short-lived control of the
   hostname from setting long-lived pins.  It also makes it safer for
   sites to experiment with TACKs, as a new TACK can be discarded
   without causing long-lived problems.  The 30 day limit guarantees
   that a worst-case pin can be recovered from in reasonable time.

   In addition to creating and activating pins, a TLS connection can
   alter the clients's pin store by publishing revocation data:

   Min_generation:  Each pin stores the highest "min_generation" value
      it has seen from the pinned TACK key, and rejects TACKs from
      earlier generations.

   Break signatures:  A TLS handshake may send break signatures which
      cause all pins for the broken key to be discarded.

4.  TACK Extension

4.1.  Definition of TACK_Extension

   A new TLS ExtensionType ("tack") is defined and MAY be included by a
   TLS client in the ClientHello message defined in [RFC5246].

   enum {tack(TBD), (65535)} ExtensionType;

   The "extension_data" field of this ClientHello SHALL be empty.  A TLS
   server which is not resuming a TLS session MAY respond with an
   extension of type "tack" in the ServerHello.  The "extension_data"
   field of this ServerHello SHALL contain a "TACK_Extension", as
   defined below using the TLS presentation language from [RFC5246].

   enum (disabled(0), enabled(1)} TACK_Activation;

   struct {
      opaque public_key[64];
      uint8  min_generation;
      uint8  generation;
      uint32 expiration;
      opaque target_hash[32];
      opaque signature[64];
   } TACK;  /* 166 bytes */

   struct {
      opaque public_key[64];
      opaque signature[64];
   } TACK_Break_Sig;  /* 128 bytes */

   struct {
      TACK tack<0...166>  /* 0 or 1 TACK */
      TACK_Break_Sig  break_sigs<0...1024>  /* 0...8 Break Sigs */
      TACK_Activation pin_activation;
   } TACK_Extension;

4.2.  Explanation of TACK_Extension fields

4.2.1.  TACK fields

   public_key:  This field specifies the TACK's public key.  The field
      contains a pair of integers (x, y) representing a point on the
      elliptic curve P-256 defined in [FIPS186-3].  Each integer is
      encoded as a 32-byte octet string using the Integer-to-Octet-
      String algorithm from [RFC6090], and these strings are
      concatenated with the x value first.  (NOTE: This is equivalent to
      an uncompressed subjectPublicKey from [RFC5480], except that the
      initial 0x04 byte is omitted).

   min_generation:  This field publishes a min_generation value.

   generation:  This field assigns each TACK a generation.  Generations
      less than a published min_generation are considered revoked.

   expiration:  This field specifies a time after which the TACK is
      considered expired.  The time is encoded as the number of minutes,
      excluding leap seconds, after midnight UTC, January 1 1970.

   target_hash:  This field is a hash of the TLS server's
      SubjectPublicKeyInfo [RFC5280] using the SHA256 algorithm from
      [FIPS180-2].  The SubjectPublicKeyInfo is typically conveyed as
      part of the server's X.509 certificate.

   signature:  This field is an ECDSA signature by the TACK's public key
      over the 8 byte ASCII string "tack_sig" followed by the contents
      of the TACK prior to the "signature" field (i.e. the preceding 102
      bytes).  The field contains a pair of integers (r, s) representing
      an ECDSA signature as defined in [FIPS186-3], using curve P-256
      and SHA256.  Each integer is encoded as a 32-byte octet string
      using the Integer-to-Octet-String algorithm from [RFC6090], and
      these strings are concatenated with the r value first.

4.2.2.  TACK_Break_Sig fields

   public_key:  This field specifies the TACK key being broken.  The key
      is encoded as per TACK.public_key.

   signature:  This field is an ECDSA signature by the TACK_Break_Sig's
      public key over the 14 byte ASCII string "tack_break_sig".  The
      field contains a pair of integers (r, s) representing an ECDSA
      signature as defined in [FIPS186-3], using curve P-256 and SHA256.
      It is calculated and encoded as per TACK.signature.

4.2.3.  TACK_Extension fields

   tack:  This field provides the server's TACK.  It MAY be empty, or
      may contain a TACK.

   break_sigs:  This field provides break signatures.  It MAY be empty,
      or MAY contain up to 8 break signatures.

   pin_activation:  If pin activation is enabled, then the
      TACK_Extension MAY be used by clients to activate or extend the
      activation of TACK pins.  This field is typically toggled from a
      disabled to an enabled state once TACKs have been deployed to all
      TLS servers for a hostname.

   Note that both the "tack" and "break_sigs" fields MAY be empty.

5.  Client processing

5.1.  TACK pins, key records, and name records

   A client supporting TACK SHALL have a local store of pins, consisting
   of "key records" and "name records".  Each name record is associated
   with a key record.  Multiple name records may be associated with one
   key record.  A "pin" refers to a (name record, key record) pair.

   A "key record" contains:

      TACK public key (or hash): A public key or a cryptographically-
      secure, second preimage-resistant hash of a public key.  A client
      SHALL NOT store multiple key records referencing the same key.

      Min_generation: A single byte used to detect revoked TACKs.

   A "name record" contains:

      Name: A fully qualified DNS hostname.  A client SHALL NOT store
      multiple name records with the same name.  The TLS server's
      hostname is considered the "relevant name", and a pin whose name
      exactly matches the relevant name is considered a "relevant pin".

      Initial timestamp: A timestamp noting when this pin was created.

      Active period end: Empty or a timestamp.  If empty or set to a
      time in the past, the pin is "inactive".  If set to a future time,
      the pin is "active" until that time.

5.2.  High-level client processing

   A TACK client SHALL send the "tack" extension defined previously, as
   well as the "server_name" extension from [RFC6066] indicating the
   hostname the client is contacting.

   If not resuming a session, the server MAY respond with a
   TACK_Extension.  If so, the TACK client SHALL perform the following
   sequence of steps prior to using the TLS connection:

   1.  Discard pins based on break signatures (if present).

   2.  Check for a valid TACK.

   3.  Update and activate pins based on a valid TACK (if present).

Internet-Draft    Trust Assertions for Certificate Keys         May 2012


   If, after the above steps, there is a relevant active pin and a valid
   TACK, then the connection is verified by the pin.  If there is a
   relevant active pin but no valid TACK, the connection is rejected by
   the pin.  A rejected connection may indicate a network attack or some
   other communication failure, and a client SHOULD NOT send or receive
   data on such a connection.

5.3.  Client processing details

5.3.1.  Discarding pins based on break signatures

   All key records broken by break signatures SHALL be discarded, along
   with their associated name records.  A key record is broken by a
   break signature if the break signature passes the following checks:

   1.  The "public_key" is referenced by the key record.

   2.  The "signature" is a correct ECDSA signature.

5.3.2.  Checking for a valid TACK

   A TACK is "valid" if it passes the following checks:

   1.  The "public_key" is referenced by the relevant active pin's key
       record, or there is no relevant active pin.

   2.  The "generation" is >= "min_generation".

   3.  The "generation" is >= the "min_generation" of the key record
       referencing the TACK public key, or there is no such key record.

   4.  The "expiration" is non-expired.

   5.  The "target_hash" is equal to the SHA256 hash of the server's
       SubjectPublicKeyInfo.

   6.  The "signature" is a correct ECDSA signature.

   7.  The TLS handshake completes successfully.

Internet-Draft    Trust Assertions for Certificate Keys         May 2012


5.3.3.  Updating and activating pins based on a valid TACK

   A valid TACK is used to update the client's pin store.  If there is a
   key record referencing the TACK key, the key record's min_generation
   SHALL be set to the TACK's min_generation if it is larger.

   A valid TACK MAY also be used to modify the name records using the
   "pin activation" process described below.  Note that the following
   steps are optional; a client MAY rely on an external source of pins.

   If there is a relevant pin referencing the TACK key, and pin
   activation is enabled, the name record's "active period end" MAY be
   set using the following formula (where "current" is the current time,
   and "initial" is the "initial timestamp" from the name record):

   active_period_end = current + MIN(30 days, current - initial)

   If there is no relevant pin, or the relevant pin is both inactive and
   does not reference the TACK key, a new pin MAY be created:

   1.  If the TACK key is referenced by an existing key record, the key
       record is reused, otherwise a new key record is created with the
       TACK's key and min_generation.

   2.  A new name record is created containing the relevant name, an
       "initial timestamp" equal to the current time, and an empty
       "active period end".

   3.  If there was an existing relevant name record, it is discarded.

   The following table summarizes this behavior based on whether the
   relevant pin is active and references the TACK's public key.  The
   "(*)" means "if pin activation is enabled".

   +------------+---------------------+-------------------------------+
   | Pin status | Pin references TACK | Result                        |
   +------------+---------------------+-------------------------------+
   | Active     | Yes                 | Extend activation period (*)  |
   |            |                     |                               |
   | Active     | No                  | Rejected                      |
   |            |                     |                               |
   | Inactive   | Yes                 | Activate pin (*)              |
   |            |                     |                               |
   | Inactive   | No                  | Replace with new inactive pin |
   |            |                     |                               |
   | None       | -                   | Create new inactive pin       |
   +------------+---------------------+-------------------------------+

5.3.4.  Deleting pins

   A client MAY delete pins from its local store at any time, whether to
   save space, protect privacy, or for any other reason.  To delete a
   pin, its name record SHALL be removed.  If this leaves a key record
   with no associated name records, the key record MAY be removed as
   well.  Pins may be deleted regardless of whether they are active or
   inactive, however for security concerns regarding pin deletion, see
   Section 8.2.

   Deleting pins obviously reduces the benefits of TACK, so SHOULD be
   avoided.

5.4.  Application-specific pinning

   In addition to the hostname-based pinning described above, some
   applications may also require "application-specific pins", where some
   application-layer name is pinned to a TACK key.  For example, an SMTP
   MTA may wish to authenticate receiving MTAs by pinning email domains
   to the receiving MTAs' TACK keys.

   Application-specific pins may require redefinition of the name
   record's "name" field, the "relevant name" for the TLS connection,
   and the "pin activation" signal.  With these items redefined, the
   client processing rules in this section may be reused.

   Note that a server using application-specific pins is still subject
   to hostname pins, and a client MAY apply either or both forms of
   pinning when checking whether the TLS connection is verified.

   The specification of application-specific pinning for particular
   applications is outside the scope of this document.

6.  TACK IDs

   A "TACK ID" MAY be used to represent a TACK public key to users in a
   form that is relatively easy to compare and transcribe.  A TACK ID
   consists of the first 25 characters from the base32 encoding of
   SHA256(public_key), separated into 5 groups of 5 characters separated
   by periods.  Base32 encoding is as specified in [RFC4648], except
   lowercase is used.

   Example TACK IDs:

      quxiz.kpldu.uuedc.j5znm.7mqst

      a334f.bt7ts.ljb3b.y24ij.6zhwm

      ebsx7.z22qt.okobu.ibhut.xzdny

7.  Advice

7.1.  For server operators

   Key reuse:  All servers that are pinned to a single key are able to
      impersonate each other, since clients will perceive their TACKs as
      equivalent.  Thus, TACK keys should not be reused with different
      hostnames unless these hostnames are closely related.  Examples
      where it would be safe to reuse a TACK key are hostnames aliased
      to the same host, or hostnames for a pool of near-identical
      servers.

   Aliases:  A TLS server may be referenced by multiple hostnames.
      Clients may pin any of these hostnames.  Server operators should
      be careful when using such DNS aliases that hostnames are not
      pinned inadvertently.

   Generations:  To revoke older generations of TACKs, the server
      operator should first provide all servers with a new generation of
      TACKs, and only then provide servers with new TACKs containing the
      new min_generation.  Otherwise, a client may receive a
      min_generation update from one server but then try to contact an
      older-generation server which has not yet been updated.

   Signature expiration:  It is convenient to set the TACK expiration
      equal to the end-entity certificate expiration, so that the TACK
      and certificate may both be replaced at the same time.
      Alternatively, short-lived TACKs may be used so that a compromised
      TLS private key has limited value to an attacker.

   Break signatures:  A break signature only needs to be published for a
      time interval equal to the maximum active period of any affected
      pins.  For example, if a TACK has been only been published on a
      website for 24 hours, to remove the TACK only requires publishing
      the break signature for 24 hours.

   Pin activation:  Pin activation should only be enabled once all TLS
      servers sharing the same hostname have a valid TACK.  Otherwise, a
      client may activate a pin by contacting one server, then contact a
      different server at the same hostname that does not yet have a
      valid TACK.

   Pin deactivation:  The pin_activation field can be used to phase out
      TACKs for a hostname - if all servers at a hostname disable pin
      activation, existing pins will eventually all become deactivated
      (within 30 days at most).

7.2.  For client implementers

   Sharing pin information:  It is possible for a client to maintain a
      pin store based entirely on its own TLS connections.  However,
      such a client runs the risk of creating incorrect pins, failing to
      keep its pins active, or failing to receive revocation information
      (min_generation updates and break signatures).  Clients are
      advised to collaborate so that pin data can be aggregated and
      shared.  This will likely require additional protocols outside the
      scope of this document.

   Clock synchronization:  A client SHOULD take measures to prevent
      valid TACKs from being rejected due to an inaccurate client clock.
      Such methods MAY include using time synchronization protocols such
      as NTP [RFC5905], or accepting seemingly-expired TACKs if they
      expired less than T minutes ago, where T is a "tolerance bound"
      set to the client's maximum expected clock error.

8.  Security considerations

8.1.  For server operators

   All servers sharing a TACK key can impersonate each other.  Using
   different TACK keys for different hostnames is a good practice.

   Make backup copies of the TACK private key and keep all copies in
   secure locations where they can't be compromised.

   A TACK private key MUST NOT be used to perform any non-TACK
   cryptographic operations.  For example, using a TACK key for email
   encryption, code-signing, or any other purpose MUST NOT be done.

   HTTP cookies [RFC6265] set by a pinned host can be stolen by a
   network attacker who can forge web and DNS responses so as to cause a
   client to send the cookies to a phony subdomain of the pinned host.
   To prevent this, TACK HTTPS Servers SHOULD set the "secure" attribute
   and omit the "domain" attribute on all security-sensitive cookies,
   such as session cookies.  These settings tell the browser that the
   cookie should only be presented back to the originating host (not its
   subdomains), and should only be sent over HTTPS (not HTTP) [RFC6265].

8.2.  For client implementers

   A TACK pin store may contain details of the client's connection
   history which the user considers private.  An attacker may be able to
   access to this information by hacking or stealing the client.  Some
   information about the client's connection history can also be gleaned
   by observing whether the client accepts or rejects connections to
   phony TLS servers.  To mitigate these risks, a TACK client SHOULD
   allow the user to edit or clear the pin store.

   Aside from rejecting TLS connections, clients SHOULD NOT take any
   actions which would reveal to a network observer the state of the
   client's pin store, as this would allow an attacker to know in
   advance whether a "man-in-the-middle" attack on a particular TLS
   connection will succeed or be detected.

   An attacker may attempt to flood a client with spurious TACKs for
   different hostnames, causing the client to delete old pins to make
   space for new ones.  To defend against this, clients SHOULD NOT
   delete active pins to make space for new pins.  Clients instead
   SHOULD delete inactive pins.  If there are no inactive pins to
   delete, then the pin store is full and there is no space for new
   pins.  To select an inactive pin for deletion, the client SHOULD
   delete the pin with the oldest "active_period_end".

8.3.  Note on algorithm agility

   If the need arises for TACKs using different cryptographic algorithms
   (e.g., if SHA256 or ECDSA are shown to be weak), a "v2" version of
   TACKs could be defined, requiring assignment of a new TLS Extension
   number.  TACKs as defined in this document would then be known as
   "v1" TACKs.

9.  IANA considerations

9.1.  New entry for the TLS ExtensionType Registry

   IANA is requested to add an entry to the existing TLS ExtensionType
   registry, defined in [RFC5246], for tack(TBD) as defined in this
   document.
